# bt3-gsc-voice-detector
A datamining tool made in Eclipse, that takes a GSC (Dragon History scenario file) and determines which voice lines are used & unused.
To ensure that it works, the project comes with the GSC file used for Saiyan Saga's "Common Enemy" scenario.

## Known Issues
* As of now, this program is command-line only.
* I cannot get a proper runnable JAR release of the program because of certain issues with Eclipse's export feature.
  Because of that, there are no download/build instructions provided. Guilty as charged.
